# Elements-of-Programming-Interviews-Variants-Solutions-in-C-In-Progress-
I see that there aren't any significant resources with solutions to the variants in the book (Elements of programming interview), so I am trying to create one with the variants that I solve as I study through the books.

This is my first experience with using github and I might do somethings inappropriately, so pardon me as I adapt to the platform, and feel free to email me suggestions if any of my codes are in error or could be implemented more efficiently.
